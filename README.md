"site_books_bot" is a newly developed telegram bot that leverages APIs to provide a seamless book-related experience. This repository houses essential files including .env.example, api.py, bot.py, buttons.py, config.py, and requirements.txt. These files collectively empower the bot's functionality.


This is a project where I've created a new telegram bot that harnesses APIs to enhance your book-related experiences. This telegram bot is designed to make interacting with book-related data and information a breeze. Whether you're looking for book recommendations, summaries, or details about your favorite authors, this bot has got you covered.

Files in this Repository:

.env.example: This file provides an example template for the environment variables that the telegram bot might require. It's important to set up environment variables securely to keep sensitive information safe.

api.py: In this file, you'll find the code responsible for communicating with external APIs. This is where the magic happens â€“ fetching book data, author details, and other relevant information.

bot.py: The heart of the telegram bot resides in this file. It contains the main functionality and logic for user interactions. From processing user queries to delivering responses, this is where it all comes together.

buttons.py: Interactivity is key, and this file holds the code for generating interactive buttons that users can click to perform specific actions within the bot interface.

config.py: Centralized configuration settings can be found in this file. Customize the behavior of the bot, such as default responses, API endpoints, and more.

requirements.txt: This file lists all the external dependencies required to run the bot successfully. It's crucial to install these dependencies to ensure the bot works as intended.
